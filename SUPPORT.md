# Support

Please be aware that this tool is an experiment and aims to assist AL developers to easily make data integration between Dynamics 365 Business Central and Dataverse. The tool is not supported by the Dynamics 365 Business Central product group in Microsoft and was created with the sole intention of inspiring the community. Because of the paucity of resources, our support on this tool is very limited. Please expect delays in responding to your queries or bugs.
